This tip will show you how you can easily add a welcome message to your terminal. This message will be displayed at the start, whenever you open your terminal.

Here are the steps to follow:

**Step 1:**
You need to install figlet. So open the terminal and type the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install figlet
```

Then press Enter.

**Step 2:**
Open `.bashrc` in Vim editor and get into insert mode.

```bash
vim ~/.bashrc
```

**Step 3:**
Enter the following command in `.bashrc`:

```bash
figletx -c your-message
```

Save and exit.

**Step 4:**
Now, when you open your terminal, you can see your welcome message.

To make your message more interesting, try using ASCII art. I recommend this website to generate ASCII art â€“ [ascii.mastervb.net](http://ascii.mastervb.net){:target="_blank"}

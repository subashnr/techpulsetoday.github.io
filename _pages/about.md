<p>Thanks for stopping by guys! I'm Vijayan and Techpulse is my beloved brainchild. Currently working as a PHP developer in a digital marketing start-up, I'm overly passionate about not just learning new things but also putting those into practice. I swear by a quote I once came across... 'What separates successful people from unsuccessful people is the former's ability to execute'. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions or feedback. Hoping to see more of you here!</p>
